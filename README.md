The goal of this project was to implement and evaluate a decentralised membership service that provides information about all the participating processes. SWIM is an advanced protocol that uses piggybacking in order to achieve greater scalability and better performance with respect to the pure heartbeat mechanism. The entire protocol has been developed and tested using Kompics framework for simulation (Java).

##TODO

Further investigation on the current NAT traversal tool's implementation is required to assure the correct functioning under diversified circumstances.
